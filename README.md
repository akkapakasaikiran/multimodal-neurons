# Multimodal Neurons: A Paper Presentation

A paper presentation of Multimodal Neurons in Artificial Neural Networks by Goh et. al. ([paper](https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/), [blog](https://openai.com/blog/multimodal-neurons/)), you can find it here: https://akkapakasaikiran.github.io/multimodal-neurons/.


I made this for [CS689](https://sites.google.com/site/harishguruprasad/teaching/topics-in-ml-iitb-aug-2021) (*Machine Learning: Theory and Methods*), an amazing course I took in my final year (Autumn 2021) at IIT Bombay. It was offered by [Prof. Harish Guruprasad Ramaswamy](https://sites.google.com/site/harishguruprasad/home), who was visiting IITB for a semester.

I also made some notes to accompany the slides. You can find them [here](notes.md).
